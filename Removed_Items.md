[Download Putty.exe found here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to  **PiSetup**.  
Look under **Alternative Binary Files**  
Download Putty.exe - the SSH/Telnet client.  
I am using the 64 bit version. You should too if you are using a 64 bit machine.  
This exe is ready to run. No need to install.  
The SHA1 hash can be checked using NodeJS the same way that the Raspian OS was checked or you can use the Win32 Disk Imager.  
There is a link at the very bottom of the download page that will take you to a listing of all the SHA1 hashes for the various downloads offered.  
I have read that getting the SHA1 hash from the same website that the downloaded file comes from is a pretty useless exercise if the website has been compromised but I am doing it anyway because at least it ensures that the file has not been tampered with during the download process.
